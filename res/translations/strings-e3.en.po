msgstr "One of the most dangerous and best guarded secrets of all mages is the knowledge about the power of death. Even though most of them would not openly admit it, and it is at least partially forbidden in most countries, each of them studies death sooner or later. When they do, they quickly find out that there is another plane of existance: the home of the demons. Only blood can quelch the thirst of those, when they switch from their home to our world. But experienced mages will find out that the demons bloodwine can be deluted when appropiate herbs are included, making it enough for 100 instead of 10 demons. As the demons may not know about that, the magician has to secretly sacrifice one of his freed minions."

msgstr "Some mages research death's secrets until they can bring the dead back to life. But those who are brought back are often only shadows of ther former self and turn against their erstwhile friends. But those mages that study life and its iteraction with death find a possibility to bring the deceased back as their original selves. A drawback is that this is only possible in the very first minutes after death. As even mages can not be everywhere at the same time, a way had to be found to give this ability to helpers. All healers who tried to learn this from the mages failed, though, until one of those healers was backstabbingly killed. In the moment of his death he used the knowledge gained and was able to have his murderer executed the following day. The potion he designed has to be blessed by a magician before usage at any given time. This potion gives four people (or one person four times) a 50% chance to survive an otherwise deadly wound. It is used automatically by the victom."

msgstr "Just like with the knowledge about death, the peasants feel uncomfortable with the knowledge about monsters. A few warriors though, who have already faced these creatures in combat, found that the monsters blood had an invigourating effect on them. There is talk about some warriors who bathed in the blood of the slain monsters to take up their strength. But this effect ends soon, and only occurs with fresh blood. As no one has time to quickly slay a wyrm before attacking their neighbors, a way had to be found to make the effect last longer. After lots of experiments that cost the life of lots of good warriors who had to constantly bring in fresh dragon blood, Manasouf the black finally found a way. Originally a closely guarded secret, the recipe is now known in all lands. First, the hardened dragon blood needs to be melted in hot tin. After that, the magician binds the spirit of the dragon to its blood once again. It can not find eternal rest until the last bit of blood has been used. "

While doing so he calls upon the spirits of fertility, which of course only listen when he talkes to them.
