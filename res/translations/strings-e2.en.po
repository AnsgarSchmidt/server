msgid "earn_silver#cerddor"
msgstr "The mages of Cerddor truly are the bards of the wizards; they love to use their sorcery to entertain the crowds and to be the center of attention.

By the end of the week, the bard will have earned 50 silver per level."

msgid "earn_silver#tybied"

If the cryptic formula under the wooden shoes of the unfaithful husband really helped? - well, the peasant, who isn't capable of reading, will never know. At least it helped the magician... to fill his purse. In one week he can earn 50 silver per level that way."
