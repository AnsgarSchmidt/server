Welcome to Eressea
------------------

Playing Eressea in english is still a rather new thing (though some have 
done it for almost a year), and there may be some issues left. If you find 
any, please let us know. We're constantly trying to make Eressea a better 
game.

There is a newsgroup on news://eressea.upb.de/eressea.lang.en dealing 
especially with the english language version, if you want to be more involved.
You will need to log in with your faction's number and password to use this 
server.

The single most important thing to know is the help. You can find it at 
http://eressea.upb.de/rules/en/ and should read it before you start playing.

If you have a question or think you found a bug, please send it to 
eressea-help@eressea.kn-bremen.de - the people reading those mails can filter 
the requests, give answers to known problems or common questions, and in general 
you'll get a very quick response. The exception are problems with your account 
or with mailhandling, these you should send directly to 
eressea-bugs@eressea.kn-bremen.de.


We hope you enjoy the game,
The Eressea Team
